# Highschool-Discord

Discord bot to manage a discord server for my highschool

## Highlight Feature
* Creates grade text channels (grade 11)
* Creates department text channels (science)
* Creates course text channels (Grade 11 Academic Chemistry) Only if more than 5 people from that course is in the server.
